# Timetable Clock

##Deprecated
This program no longer supports getting school timetable due to infrastructure changes in the school.
A new program has been made to fix this [MYTGS](https://github.com/Torca2001/MYTGS)

## Description

This is basically a clock which downloads your school timetable, and displays what period is next, and how much time until the current period ends.

## Controls & Tips
